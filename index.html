        <p>Such iteration relies on well-planned and active pipelines designed to support multiple iterations in various stages of the development cycle simultaneously -- and keep entire development teams constantly busy. The key is that all of the stages that compose a CI/CD pipeline are working simultaneously on different iterations of the software. For example, as one mature build is staged or deployed to production, a younger build is being tested and validated, while an even younger version is being coded and built -- and future builds are being designed to continue the software development lifecycle.

Let's take a closer look at these continuous approaches, see how each works, weigh the tradeoffs and consider best practices.(CI) focuses on the early stages of a software development pipeline where the code changes are built into artifacts that undergo automated tests. Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously and make frequent commits to the code repository. Build frequency can be daily or even several times per day at some points in the project's lifecycle. These small, frequent builds enable easy and low-risk experimentation, as well as the ability to easily roll back or abandon undesirable outcomes.</p>
